# Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Course Overview

The LLM Zoomcamp course focuses on practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The primary project is to build a Q&A system that leverages FAQs from multiple courses to answer student queries efficiently. The system will use LLMs and RAG to process questions and provide accurate answers based on a knowledge base of FAQ documents.

### Problem Statement

- **Context**: The course community maintains extensive FAQ documents (e.g., 321 pages for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp) with a question-answer format organized by sections.
- **Challenge**: Finding specific answers in these large documents is inefficient, as students must manually search through numerous questions.
- **Solution**: Develop a Q&A system where users input a question via a simple form, and the system retrieves relevant FAQ content to generate accurate answers using LLMs and RAG.

### Course Goals

- Learn to use LLMs and RAG to build a Q&A system.
- Understand how to integrate a knowledge base with an LLM for context-aware responses.
- Implement the system with a user-friendly interface (e.g., Streamlit) by the course's end.
- Apply the learned concepts to a custom knowledge base.

## Understanding LLMs

### Definition

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced machine learning models designed to predict the next word or token in a sequence based on prior text. They are distinguished by their massive scale and ability to generate human-like responses.

### Key Characteristics

- **Scale**: LLMs have billions of parameters and are trained on vast datasets, enabling sophisticated language understanding and generation.
- **Functionality**: They predict the next word based on preceding text, making them capable of completing sentences or answering questions coherently.
- **Black Box Approach**: In this course, LLMs are treated as black boxes, focusing on their input-output behavior rather than internal mechanisms (e.g., Transformer architectures).
- **Comparison to Simple Language Models**:
  - Simple language models (e.g., those in phone keyboards) predict the next word with limited parameters and simpler algorithms (e.g., n-gram models).
  - LLMs, due to their scale, provide more accurate and contextually relevant predictions, resembling human-like understanding.

### How LLMs Work

- **Input (Prompt)**: LLMs receive text input, called a prompt, which defines the task or question.
- **Output**: The model generates a response by predicting the next logical sequence of words.
- **Prompt Structure Example**:

  ```text
  Question: How do I enroll in the course?
  Context: [Relevant FAQ content]
  Answer:
  ```

  - The LLM completes the prompt by generating an answer based on the question and provided context.
  - Modern LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) may not require explicit "Answer:" markers, but this structure clarifies expectations for the course project.
- **Example**: Typing "How are" on a phone might suggest "you" or "there" based on common phrases. LLMs extend this concept with greater accuracy due to their extensive training.

### Applications and Limitations

- **Strengths**: LLMs excel at general knowledge tasks (e.g., "How do I cook salmon?") where they can provide comprehensive answers without external context.
- **Limitations**: LLMs struggle with specific or niche queries (e.g., "Is it too late to join the course?") without additional context, as they lack access to course-specific information.

## Exploring RAG

### Definition

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines **retrieval** (searching a knowledge base) with **generation** (using an LLM) to produce contextually relevant answers. The retrieval component augments the LLM’s generation by providing external information.

### Why RAG is Needed

- **LLM Limitations**: LLMs may provide vague or incorrect answers for queries requiring specific or up-to-date information (e.g., course enrollment details).
- **Role of Retrieval**: Retrieval fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base to provide the LLM with the necessary context for accurate responses.
- **Example**:
  - Query: "How do I cook salmon?"
    - LLM can answer directly using its training data.
  - Query: "How do I enroll in the Data Engineering Zoomcamp?"
    - LLM needs context from FAQ documents to provide a precise answer.

### RAG Framework

The RAG framework integrates two core components:

1. **Knowledge Base**: A repository of documents (e.g., course FAQs) containing questions and answers.
2. **LLM**: A model that generates responses based on the query and retrieved context.

### RAG Workflow

1. **User Query**:
   - A user submits a question (e.g., "How do I enroll in the course?").
2. **Retrieval**:
   - The query is sent to the knowledge base.
   - Relevant documents (e.g., D1, D2, ..., D5) are retrieved, containing FAQ entries related to the query.
3. **Prompt Construction**:
   - A prompt is created combining the query and retrieved documents:

     ```text
     Question: How do I enroll in the course?
     Context: [D1, D2, ..., D5]
     Answer:
     ```

4. **Generation**:
   - The LLM processes the prompt, using the context to generate an accurate answer.
5. **Response Delivery**:
   - The generated answer is returned to the user.

### Example Use Case

- **Scenario**: A student asks, "Is it too late to join the course?"
- **Problem**: The LLM lacks course-specific details and cannot answer accurately without context.
- **RAG Solution**:
  - Retrieve FAQ entries about enrollment deadlines.
  - Combine the query with retrieved documents in a prompt.
  - The LLM generates a precise answer based on the context.

### Flexibility of RAG

- **Knowledge Base**:
  - Initial implementation uses a simple toy search engine to demonstrate concepts.
  - Later modules upgrade to Elasticsearch for text-based search.
  - Advanced modules explore Vector search for semantic retrieval (to be covered later).
- **LLM**:
  - The course may use various LLMs, with prompts adjusted for compatibility.
  - Open-source LLMs can replace proprietary ones, requiring prompt tweaks.
- **Modularity**: The RAG framework allows swapping components (e.g., search engine or LLM) to optimize performance.

## Course Implementation Details

- **Project Objective**: Build a Q&A system for course FAQs using RAG.
- **Components**:
  - **Knowledge Base**: FAQ documents from multiple courses (e.g., Data Engineering Zoomcamp).
  - **Search Engine**:
    - Start with a toy search engine for simplicity.
    - Upgrade to Elasticsearch in later modules.
    - Explore Vector search for advanced retrieval.
  - **LLM**: Use an LLM to generate answers, with flexibility to switch models.
  - **User Interface**: Implement a simple form (e.g., using Streamlit) for question input and answer display.
- **Learning Outcomes**:
  - Understand LLM and RAG integration.
  - Build and test a Q&A system.
  - Apply the system to a custom knowledge base by the course's end.

## Additional Notes

- **Future Topics**:
  - Environment setup for running LLMs and RAG (covered in subsequent lessons).
  - Advanced retrieval techniques like Vector search for semantic understanding.
  - Customizing prompts for different LLMs.
  - Deploying the Q&A system with a user interface.
- **Practical Considerations**:
  - The course treats LLMs as black boxes, focusing on practical application over theoretical details.
  - The FAQ-based Q&A system addresses real-world inefficiencies in accessing course information.
- **Extensibility**: The RAG framework’s modularity allows experimentation with different search engines and LLMs, preparing students for real-world adaptations.
